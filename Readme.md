# Experiments with golang

Recently I have gained some interest in `go` after working with some tools made purely in go. So, I researched a bit on it and the language looked quite interesting to me who has previous experience with Python and C++. I pinned down on the book [The Go Programming Languange][1] by Brian Kernighan and Alan Donovan and the [Golang official tour][2].

This repository will contain my solutions to the exercise problems of the book and anything that may seem relevant to me.
